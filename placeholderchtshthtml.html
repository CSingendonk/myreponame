            Is anybody listening?
            <br />
            It's like I'm yelling, but I'm whispering
            <br />
            It's like it doesn't even matter
            <br />
            (I'm talking fast), but it's idle chatter
            <br />
            If you can feel me, hear me out
            <br />
            I got something to talk about
            <br />
            I promise I won't waste your time
            <br />
            Nevermind, I'm lying
            <br />
            Hello walls, hello ceiling
            <br />
            No one's home, and I'm feeling
            <br />
            All alone
            <br />
            Hello bed, hello pillow
            <br />
            When I'm high, I still feel low
            <br />
            No one knows me like my things

            <br />
            But no one answers when I scream:

            <br />
            Hello walls!

            <br />
            Laying in this bed I fear
            <br />
            Me filling my brain with some leads right near
            <br />
            I think if I do this my head I clear
            <br />
            Or maybe I should overdose on these meds right here?
            <br />
            Everytime I get ahead a wall hits me, fall quick
            <br />
            Do y'all history, when it came to my artistry it was all iffy
            <br />
            The laws just be raw, this we call shifty
            <br />
            Tall chips to fix me, ball, stalled, it be all thrifty
            <br />
            I don't let nobody see my pain behind these walls
            <br />
            Bet this blade will help me see my veins
            <br />
            Cause these walls are caving in and the ceiling's getting closer to me
            <br />
            Everybody is unhappy with me and taking away all dough's a doozy
            <br />
            I feel so, helpless and nervous that I will go ill
            <br />
            So freaking real though and spill slow
            <br />
            Caribou Coffee tryna stop my 'Bou Lou mill
            <br />
            So my grill show daily, but nightly tears upon my pillow
            <br />
            Right now I'm real low.

            <br />
            So.

            <br />
            Hello walls, hello ceiling
            <br />
            No one's home, and I'm feeling
            <br />
            All alone
            <br />
            Hello bed, hello pillow
            <br />
            When I'm high, I still feel low
            <br />
            No one knows me like my things

            <br />
            But no one answers when I scream:

            <br />
            Hello walls!

            <br />
            My life looks like a party that never ends
            <br />
            I can't tell what's business and what's friends
            <br />
            I think they pretend to like me
            <br />
            And then I'm slightly get thrown off my look now
            <br />
            Why they phone of the hook, huh?
            <br />
            It's getting harder, to make it through the weekend
            <br />
            I try to push it farther, they act like I ain't speaking
            <br />
            I walk to the door, there's no one else to walk to
            <br />
            I talk to the wall, there's no one else to talk to
            <br />
            (And I keep feeling invisible)

            <br />
            Hello walls, hello ceiling
            <br />
            No one's home, and I'm feeling
            <br />
            All alone
            <br />
            Hello bed, hello pillow
            <br />
            When I'm high, I still feel low
            <br />
            No one knows me like my things
            <br />
            But no one answers when I scream:
            <br />
            Hello walls!

            <br />
            Hello walls...
