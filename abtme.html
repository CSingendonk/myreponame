In order to accomplish a passing grade in all my courses so I can continue my pursuit of knowledge in a passion I had written off as a pipedream for a decade. Accomplishing that goal and the sub-goals involved will bring me closer to credentials that will advance my path to turning a passion into an income, a side effect of which will be more resources to recycle towards the continuation and delegation of the duties carried out by my small business, to ultimately benefit more people all around.</td>
